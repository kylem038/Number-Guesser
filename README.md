<h1>Welcome to Number Guesser!<h1>
Our application utilizes the following user interface components:

An input field for guessing the number.
A button for submitting a guess.
A button for clearing the input field.
A button that resets the game to its initial state.
An element that displays the users most recent guess.
An element that displays a message to user.
If their guess is too high, it should display: “Sorry, that guess is too high. Try a lower number.”
If their guess is too low, it should display: “Sorry, that guess is too low. Try a higher number.”

Later in the project we added the ability for the user to set the range of numbers that will be guessed. We also added in
an alert for the user when they either submit something that isn't a number, or if the number is outside the range that they set. 
Additionally we were able to disable the buttons if there is nothing to clear &/or the the game hasn't been played yet. 

Finally, we added in a level up feature so that if you guess right, the min & max both increase by 10 making the game 
continually harder.
